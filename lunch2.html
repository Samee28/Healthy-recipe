       <li> ⅓ cup dry white wine</li>
        
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes</li>
        
       <li> 2 ounces cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>

<big><strong>Directions</strong>
         
<div>Pat salmon dry and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon each salt and pepper.

 Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

 Add the salmon and cook until the underside is browned and 

 releases easily from the pan, 3 to 4 minutes.
  Flip the salmon 

 and continue to cook until opaque in the center,
  another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

   
Meanwhile, add the remaining 1 tablespoon 

oil, zucchini and onion to the pan. Cook,

stirring, until starting to soften, about

3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine.
 Cook, stirring, until the liquid has mostly evaporated, 
 about
2 minutes. Add tomatoes, cream cheese, Italian seasoning
, garlic powder and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon each salt
 and pepper.
  Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring,

  
  until the cream cheese is melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Return the
    salmon to the pan and turn to coat with the sauce. Serve
topped with basil.
