        <p>FBalti, a stew created by Pakistani chefs in Birmingham, England, is named after the metal pot it's cooked in. We found a large skillet works too. Topping with a dollop of yogurt adds a hint of creaminess. Serve with a side of sautéed spinach for a satisfying dinner..</p>

      <li>  3 cups unsalted beef broth</li>
        
       <li> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        
       <li> ¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        
       <li> ¼ cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt</li>

<big><strong>Directions</strong>
         
<div>Combine water and rice in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over 
high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the water
 is absorbed, about 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook beef and lamb in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
crumbling with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes.
 Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.
    


   
 Increase heat to high. Add garlic, turmeric, ginger, coriander
and cumin; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 
tomato paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in broth,
 Worcestershire and salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, 
 stirring occasionally, until thickened, 13 to 15 minutes.
    
Serve the balti over the rice, topped with some yogurt and cilantro 
with naan bread on the side.
    
<h3>Tips</h3>
To make ahead: Refrigerate balti (Steps 2-3) for up to 3 days.
    
<H3>Tip</H3>: Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties. Researchers found 
that just 2 grams (the amount in one serving of this dish) can reduce muscle 
soreness after an intense workout.
Slice and serve topped with basil.</div>
